# AllenBradleyPLC
This is an application coded in C# that facilitates communication with an Allen Bradley PLC. The application performs operations to read the values of tags created in the PLC and write to those tag values. 
To communicate with the PLC, the 'LibplctagWrapper' project is added to the application. The 'LibplctagWrapper' project is available with source code in the libplctag-csharp-master.zip file found in the repository.
